# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project

An analysis of crowd sourcing goal outcomes conducted over a period of two days utilizes data provided by Kickstarter. The data includes over 4,000 crowd sourcing campaigns broken down into 9 different categories and over 40 sub-categories. This project focuses on the “theater” category, which represents 38% of the entire data set and is the most popular project category at nearly double the next closest category. Initial discoveries include:

* Of the nearly 1400 theater campaigns, over 900 occurred in the US.
* Great Britain is a distant second behind the US in theater crowd sourcing campaigns at just under 360.
* There are three sub-categories within the theater category; “plays” represents a majority at just under 76%.
* 66% of all “play” crowd sourcing campaigns met the goal and none were canceled.

### Purpose
A Kickstarter client requests a deeper analysis of campaign outcomes based on crowd source launch dates and funding goals. The client’s crowd sourcing interest area lies with the category of theaters and specifically with the sub-category of plays.

## Analysis and Challenges
Descriptive statistics were developed based on the data set to determine the validity of the data and to identify potential outliers and errors. General cleanup of formatting was performed and subcategories were extracted to examine in more detail the “play” subcategory.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the charts and tables below, launch date trends were evaluated. The most successful launch dates for the theater category were in May and June. Least successful launch dates occurred in December. Further analysis based on the campaign's country of origin reveals that the U.S. had the most theater campaigns, with Great Britain next highests at about half of the U.S. number; however, Great Britain experiences much higher campaign success rates than the U.S.

#### Conclusions Based on Launch Dates
1. The most successful launch month for theater campaigns occurs in May, of which 67% are successful.
2. June and April also experience higher than average campaign success.
3. Great Britain has a higher success rate for June launch months, while the U.S. highest successful launch month is May.
4. The least successful launch month for theater campaigns is in December at only 49% successful; lower campaign success rates based on launch date are consistent across all countries.
5. Although Great Britain has only about 50% of the theater campaign market, their campaign success rates run much higher overall; Great Britain campaign success is 73% for all years and months launched, compared to only 58% in the U.S.
